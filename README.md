# HiltTask
An application written for educational purposes to learn more and get to know Hilt in more detail.
The application itself is simple, consisting in the fact that we write some text, then save it, while receiving a boolean value in the column, which means the text was saved or not, and by clicking on the get data button we get our text back.
